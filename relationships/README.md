# Relationships

This section covers the main relationships in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through clear concepts and visual representations.

1. Association
Association represents a basic connection between objects. It is the most fundamental relationship, where objects are associated, but they can exist independently.


2. Aggregation
Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship, where one object contains another. However, the contained object can exist independently of the parent.


3. Composition
Composition is a stronger form of aggregation, where the contained object cannot exist independently of the parent object. If the parent is destroyed, the contained objects are also destroyed.


4. Dependency
In dependency, one object depends on another for functionality. The dependent object requires another object to perform certain tasks.


5. Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The derived class can override or extend the functionality of the base class.
